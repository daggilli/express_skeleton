# Express TypeScript skeleton

This is a minimal template for an Express application using TypeScript. It is not production-grade but is useful to get started on toy projects.

Clone it, run `npm i`, `npm run build` and `npm start`. A minimal server with one GET route, `/`, will be open on port 3000. Use `PORT=` in a `.env`file to choose the port Express is listening on.
